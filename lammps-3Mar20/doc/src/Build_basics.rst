.. _serial:

Serial vs parallel build
-------------------------------------

LAMMPS is written to use the ubiquitous `MPI (Message Passing Interface)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface>`_ library API
for distributed memory parallel computation.  You need to have such a
library installed for building and running LAMMPS in parallel using a
domain decomposition parallelization.  It is compatible with the MPI
standard version 2.x and later.  LAMMPS can also be built into a
"serial" executable for use with a single processor using the bundled
MPI STUBS library.

Independent of the distributed memory MPI parallelization, parts of
LAMMPS are also written with support for shared memory parallelization
using the OpenMP threading standard. A more detailed discussion of that
is below.

**CMake build**\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   -D BUILD_MPI=value        # yes or no, default is yes if CMake finds MPI, else no
   -D BUILD_OMP=value        # yes or no, default is yes if a compatible compiler is detected
   -D LAMMPS_MACHINE=name    # name = mpi, serial, mybox, titan, laptop, etc
                             # no default value

The executable created by CMake (after running make) is named *lmp* unless
the LAMMPS\_MACHINE option is set.  When setting `LAMMPS_MACHINE=name`
the executable will be named *lmp\_name*\.  Using `BUILD\_MPI=no` will
enforce building a serial executable using the MPI STUBS library.

**Traditional make**\ :

The build with traditional makefiles has to be done inside the source folder `src`.

.. code-block:: bash

   make mpi                # parallel build, produces lmp_mpi using Makefile.mpi
   make serial             # serial build, produces lmp_serial using Makefile/serial
   make mybox              # uses Makefile.mybox to produce lmp_mybox


Any "make machine" command will look up the make settings from a file
Makefile.machine, create a folder Obj\_machine with all objects and
generated files and an executable called *lmp\_machine*\ .  The standard
parallel build with `make mpi` assumes a standard MPI installation with
MPI compiler wrappers where all necessary compiler and linker flags to
get access and link with the suitable MPI headers and libraries are set
by the wrapper programs.  For other cases or the serial build, you have
to adjust the make file variables MPI\_INC, MPI\_PATH, MPI\_LIB as well
as CC and LINK.  To enable OpenMP threading usually a compiler specific
flag needs to be added to the compile and link commands.  For the GNU
compilers, this is *-fopenmp*\ , which can be added to the CC and LINK
makefile variables.

For the serial build the following make variables are set (see src/MAKE/Makefile.serial):

.. code-block:: make

   CC =            g++
   LINK =          g++
   MPI_INC =       -I../STUBS
   MPI_PATH =      -L../STUBS
   MPI_LIB =       -lmpi_stubs

You also need to build the STUBS library for your platform before making
LAMMPS itself.  A "make serial" build does this for you automatically,
otherwise, type "make mpi-stubs" from the src directory, or "make" from
the src/STUBS dir.  If the build fails, you will need to edit the
STUBS/Makefile for your platform.  The stubs library does not provide
MPI/IO functions required by some LAMMPS packages, e.g. MPIIO or USER-LB,
and thus is not compatible with those packages.

.. note::

   The file STUBS/mpi.c provides a CPU timer function called
   MPI\_Wtime() that calls gettimeofday() .  If your operating system
   does not support gettimeofday() , you will need to insert code to
   call another timer.  Note that the ANSI-standard function clock()
   rolls over after an hour or so, and is therefore insufficient for
   timing long LAMMPS simulations.

**MPI and OpenMP support info**\ :

If you are installing MPI yourself to build a parallel LAMMPS
executable, we recommend either MPICH or OpenMPI which are regularly
used and tested with LAMMPS by the LAMMPS developers.  MPICH can be
downloaded from the `MPICH home page <https://www.mpich.org>`_ and
OpenMPI can be downloaded correspondingly from the `OpenMPI home page
<https://www.open-mpi.org>`_.  Other MPI packages should also work.  No
specific vendor provided and standard compliant MPI library is currently
known to be incompatible with LAMMPS.  If you are running on a large
parallel machine, your system admins or the vendor should have already
installed a version of MPI, which is likely to be faster than a
self-installed MPICH or OpenMPI, so you should study the provided
documentation to find out how to build and link with it.

The majority of OpenMP (threading) support in LAMMPS is provided by the
USER-OMP package; see the :doc:`Speed omp <Speed_omp>` doc page for
details. The USER-INTEL package also includes OpenMP threading (it is
compatible with USER-OMP) and adds vectorization support when compiled
with compatible compilers, in particular the Intel compilers on top of
OpenMP. Also, the KOKKOS package can be compiled to include OpenMP
threading.

In addition, there are a few commands in LAMMPS that have native OpenMP
support included as well.  These are commands in the MPIIO, SNAP,
USER-DIFFRACTION, and USER-DPD packages.  In addition some packages
support OpenMP threading indirectly through the libraries they interface
to: e.g. LATTE and USER-COLVARS.  See the :doc:`Packages details
<Packages_details>` doc page for more info on these packages and the doc
pages for their respective commands for OpenMP threading info.

For CMake, if you use BUILD\_OMP=yes, you can use these packages and
turn on their native OpenMP support and turn on their native OpenMP
support at run time, by setting the OMP\_NUM\_THREADS environment
variable before you launch LAMMPS.

For building via conventional make, the CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS
variables in Makefile.machine need to include the compiler flag that
enables OpenMP. For GNU compilers it is -fopenmp.  For (recent) Intel
compilers it is -qopenmp.  If you are using a different compiler,
please refer to its documentation.

.. _default-none-issues:

**OpenMP Compiler compatibility info**\ : 

Some compilers do not fully support the 'default(none)' directive
and others (e.g. GCC version 9 and beyond) may implement OpenMP 4.0
semantics, which are incompatible with the OpenMP 3.1 directives used
in LAMMPS (for maximal compatibility with compiler versions in use).
In those case, all 'default(none)' directives (which aid in detecting
incorrect and unwanted sharing) can be replaced with 'default(shared)'
while dropping all 'shared()' directives. The script
'src/USER-OMP/hack\_openmp\_for\_pgi\_gcc9.sh' can be used to automate
this conversion.

.. _compile:

Choice of compiler and compile/link options
---------------------------------------------------------

The choice of compiler and compiler flags can be important for
performance.  Vendor provided compilers for a specific hardware can
produce faster code than open-source compilers like the GNU compilers.
On x86 hardware most popular compilers are quite similar in performance
of C/C++ code at high optimization levels.  When using the USER-INTEL
package, there is a distinct advantage in using the `Intel C++ compiler
<intel_>`_ due to much improved vectorization through SSE and AVX
instructions on compatible hardware as the source code includes changes
and compiler directives to enable high degrees of vectorization.

.. _intel: https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers

On parallel clusters or supercomputers which use "environment modules"
for their compile/link environments, you can often access different
compilers by simply loading the appropriate module before building
LAMMPS.

**CMake build**\ :

By default CMake will use a compiler it finds and it will add
optimization flags appropriate to that compiler and any
:doc:`accelerator packages <Speed_packages>` you have included in the
build.

You can tell CMake to look for a specific compiler with these variable
settings.  Likewise you can specify the FLAGS variables if you want to
experiment with alternate optimization flags.  You should specify all
3 compilers, so that the small number of LAMMPS source files written
in C or Fortran are built with a compiler consistent with the one used
for all the C++ files:

.. code-block:: bash

   -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=name            # name of C++ compiler
   -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=name              # name of C compiler
   -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=name        # name of Fortran compiler

   -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=string             # flags to use with C++ compiler
   -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS=string               # flags to use with C compiler
   -D CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS=string         # flags to use with Fortran compiler


A few example command lines are:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Building with GNU Compilers:
   cmake ../cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran
   # Building with Intel Compilers:
   cmake ../cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort
   # Building with LLVM/Clang Compilers:
   cmake ../cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=flang

For compiling with the Clang/LLVM compilers a special CMake preset is
included that can be loaded with `-C ../cmake/presets/clang.cmake`.

.. note::

   When the cmake command completes, it prints a summary to the screen
   which compilers it is using and what flags and settings will be used
   for the  compilation.  Note that if the top-level compiler is mpicxx,
   it is simply a wrapper on a real compiler.  The underlying compiler
   info is what CMake will try to determine and report.  You should check
   to confirm you are using the compiler and optimization flags you want.

**Makefile.machine settings for traditional make**\ :

The "compiler/linker settings" section of a Makefile.machine lists
compiler and linker settings for your C++ compiler, including
optimization flags.  For a parallel build it is recommended to use
mpicxx or mpiCC, since these compiler wrappers will include a variety of
settings appropriate for your MPI installation and thus avoiding the
guesswork of finding the right flags.

Parallel build (see src/MAKE/Makefile.mpi):

.. code-block:: bash

   CC =            mpicxx
   CCFLAGS =       -g -O3
   LINK =          mpicxx
   LINKFLAGS =     -g -O

Serial build (see src/MAKE/Makefile.serial):

.. code-block:: make

   CC =            g++
   CCFLAGS =       -g -O3
   LINK =          g++
   LINKFLAGS =     -g -O

.. note::

   If you build LAMMPS with any :doc:`accelerator packages <Speed_packages>`
   included, there may be specific optimization flags that are either
   required or recommended to enable required features and to achieve
   optimal performance.  You need to include these in the CCFLAGS and
   LINKFLAGS settings above.  For details, see the individual package
   doc pages listed on the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc
   page.  Or examine these files in the src/MAKE/OPTIONS directory.
   They correspond to each of the 5 accelerator packages and their
   hardware variants:

.. code-block:: bash

   Makefile.opt                   # OPT package
   Makefile.omp                   # USER-OMP package
   Makefile.intel_cpu             # USER-INTEL package for CPUs
   Makefile.intel_coprocessor     # USER-INTEL package for KNLs
   Makefile.gpu                   # GPU package
   Makefile.kokkos_cuda_mpi       # KOKKOS package for GPUs
   Makefile.kokkos_omp            # KOKKOS package for CPUs (OpenMP)
   Makefile.kokkos_phi            # KOKKOS package for KNLs (OpenMP)

----------

.. _exe:

Build LAMMPS as an executable or a library
----------------------------------------------------

LAMMPS can be built as either an executable or as a static or shared
library.  The LAMMPS library can be called from another application or
a scripting language.  See the :doc:`Howto couple <Howto_couple>` doc
page for more info on coupling LAMMPS to other codes.  See the
:doc:`Python <Python_head>` doc page for more info on wrapping and
running LAMMPS from Python via its library interface.

**CMake build**\ :

For CMake builds, you can select through setting CMake variables which
files the compilation produces during the configuration step.  If none
are set, defaults are applied.

.. code-block:: bash

   -D BUILD_EXE=value           # yes (default) or no
   -D BUILD_LIB=value           # yes or no (default)
   -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=value   # yes or no (default)
   -D LAMMPS_LIB_SUFFIX=name    # name = mpi, serial, mybox, titan, laptop, etc
                                # no default value

Setting BUILD\_EXE=no will not produce an executable.  Setting
BUILD\_LIB=yes will produce a static library named *liblammps.a*\ .
Setting both BUILD\_LIB=yes and BUILD\_SHARED\_LIBS=yes will produce a
shared library named *liblammps.so* instead. If LAMMPS\_LIB\_SUFFIX is
set to *name* in addition, the name of the generated libraries will be
changed to either *liblammps\_name.a* or *liblammps\_name.so*\ ,
respectively.

**Traditional make**\ :

With the traditional makefile based build process, the choice of
the generated executable or library depends on the "mode" setting.
Several options are available and "mode=exe" is the default.

.. code-block:: bash

   make machine               # build LAMMPS executable lmp_machine
   mkae mode=exe machine      # same as "make machine"
   make mode=lib machine      # build LAMMPS static lib liblammps_machine.a
   make mode=shlib machine    # build LAMMPS shared lib liblammps_machine.so
   make mode=shexe machine    # same as "mode=exe" but uses objects from "mode=shlib"

The two "exe" builds will generate and executable *lmp\_machine*\ ,
while the two library builds will create a file *liblammps\_machine.a*
or *liblammps\_machine.so*\ . They will also create generic soft links,
named *liblammps.a* and *liblammps.so*\ , which point to the specific
*liblammps\_machine.a/so* files.

**CMake and make info**\ :

Note that for a shared library to be usable by a calling program, all
the auxiliary libraries it depends on must also exist as shared
libraries.  This will be the case for libraries included with LAMMPS,
such as the dummy MPI library in src/STUBS or any package libraries in
the lib/packages directory, since they are always built in a shared
library compatible way using the -fPIC switch.  However, if a library
like MPI or FFTW does not exist as a shared library, the shared library
build may generate an error.  This means you will need to install a
shared library version of the auxiliary library.  The build instructions
for the library should tell you how to do this.


As an example, here is how to build and install the `MPICH library
<mpich_>`_, a popular open-source version of MPI, as a shared library
in the default /usr/local/lib location:

.. _mpich: https://www.mpich.org

.. code-block:: bash

   ./configure --enable-shared
   make
   make install

You may need to use "sudo make install" in place of the last line if you
do not have write privileges for /usr/local/lib.  The end result should
be the file /usr/local/lib/libmpich.so.  On many Linux installations the
folder "${HOME}/.local" is an alternative to using /usr/local and does
not require superuser or sudo access.  In that case the configuration
step becomes:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=${HOME}/.local

Avoiding using "sudo" for custom software installation (i.e. from source
and not through a package manager tool provided by the OS) is generally
recommended to ensure the integrity of the system software installation.

----------


.. _doc:

Build the LAMMPS documentation
----------------------------------------

The LAMMPS manual is written in `reStructuredText <rst_>`_ format which
can be translated to different output format using the `Sphinx <sphinx_>`_
document generator tool.  Currently the translation to HTML and PDF (via
LaTeX) are supported.  For that to work a Python 3 interpreter and
internet access is required.  For the documentation build a python
based virtual environment is set up in the folder doc/docenv and various
python packages are installed into that virtual environment via the pip
tool.  The actual translation is then done via make commands.

.. _rst: https://docutils.readthedocs.io/en/sphinx-docs/user/rst/quickstart.html
.. _sphinx: https://sphinx-doc.org

**Documentation make option**\ :

The following make commands can be issued in the doc folder of the
LAMMPS source distribution.

.. code-block:: bash

  make html          # create HTML doc pages in html directory
  make pdf           # create Developer.pdf and Manual.pdf in this directory
  make fetch         # fetch HTML and PDF files from LAMMPS web site
  make clean         # remove all intermediate files
  make clean-all     # reset the entire doc build environment
  make anchor_check  # scan for duplicate anchor labels
  make style_check   # check for complete and consistent style lists
  make package_check # check for complete and consistent package lists
  make spelling      # spell-check the manual


Thus "make html" will create a "doc/html" directory with the HTML format
manual pages so that you can browse them with a web browser locally on
your system.

.. note::

   You can also download a tarball of the documentation for the
   current LAMMPS version (HTML and PDF files), from the website
   `download page <http://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html>`_.


**CMake build option**\ :

It is also possible to create the HTML version of the manual within
the :doc:`CMake build directory <Build_cmake>`.  The reason for this
option is to include the installation of the HTML manual pages into
the "install" step when installing LAMMPS after the CMake build via
"make install".

.. code-block:: bash

   -D BUILD_DOC=value       # yes or no (default)


----------


.. _tools:

Build LAMMPS tools
------------------------------

Some tools described in :doc:`Auxiliary tools <Tools>` can be built directly
using CMake or Make.

**CMake build3**\ :


.. code-block:: bash

   -D BUILD_TOOLS=value       # yes or no (default)

The generated binaries will also become part of the LAMMPS installation
(see below).

**Traditional make**\ :


.. code-block:: bash

   cd lammps/tools
   make all              # build all binaries of tools
   make binary2txt       # build only binary2txt tool
   make chain            # build only chain tool
   make micelle2d        # build only micelle2d tool
   make thermo_extract   # build only thermo_extract tool


----------


.. _install:

Install LAMMPS after a build
------------------------------------------

After building LAMMPS, you may wish to copy the LAMMPS executable of
library, along with other LAMMPS files (library header, doc files) to
a globally visible place on your system, for others to access.  Note
that you may need super-user privileges (e.g. sudo) if the directory
you want to copy files to is protected.

**CMake build**\ :


.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path [options ...] ../cmake
   make                        # perform make after CMake command
   make install                # perform the installation into prefix

**Traditional make**\ :

There is no "install" option in the src/Makefile for LAMMPS.  If you
wish to do this you will need to first build LAMMPS, then manually
copy the desired LAMMPS files to the appropriate system directories.
