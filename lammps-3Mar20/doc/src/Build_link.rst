Link LAMMPS as a library to another code
========================================

LAMMPS can be used as a library by another application, including
Python scripts.  The files src/library.cpp and library.h define the
C-style API for using LAMMPS as a library.  See the :doc:`Howto
library <Howto_library>` doc page for a description of the interface
and how to extend it for your needs.

The :doc:`Build basics <Build_basics>` doc page explains how to build
LAMMPS as either a shared or static library.  This results in one of
these 2 files:

.. parsed-literal::

   liblammps.so      # shared library
   liblammps.a       # static library

.. note::

   Care should be taken to use the same MPI library for the calling
   code and the LAMMPS library.  The library.h file includes mpi.h and
   uses definitions from it so those need to be available and
   consistent.  When LAMMPS is compiled with the MPI STUBS library,
   then its mpi.h file needs to be included.  While it is technically
   possible to use a full MPI library in the calling code and link to
   a serial LAMMPS library compiled with MPI STUBS, it is recommended
   to use the *same* MPI library for both, and then use MPI\_Comm\_split()
   in the calling code to pass a suitable communicator with a subset
   of MPI ranks to the function creating the LAMMPS instance.

----------


**Link with LAMMPS as a static library**\ :

The calling application can link to LAMMPS as a static library with
compilation and link commands as in the examples shown below.  These
are examples for a code written in C in the file *caller.c*.
The benefit of linking to a static library is, that the resulting
executable is independent of that library since all required
executable code from the library is copied into the calling executable.

*CMake build*\ :

This assumes that LAMMPS has been configured with "-D BUILD_LIB=yes"
and installed with "make install" and the PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH environment
variable updated to include the *liblammps.pc* file installed into the
configured destination folder, if needed.  The commands to compile and
link the coupled executable are then:

.. code-block:: bash

   mpicc -c -O $(pkgconf liblammps --cflags) caller.c
   mpicxx -o caller caller.o -$(pkgconf liblammps --libs)


*Traditional make*\ :

This assumes that LAMMPS has been compiled in the folder
"${HOME}/lammps/src" with "make mode=lib mpi". The commands to compile
and link the coupled executable are then:

.. code-block:: bash

   mpicc -c -O -I${HOME}/lammps/src caller.c
   mpicxx -o caller caller.o -L${HOME}/lammps/src -llammps

The *-I* argument is the path to the location of the *library.h*
header file containing the interface to the LAMMPS C-style library
interface.  The *-L* argument is the path to where the *liblammps.a*
file is located.  The *-llammps* argument is shorthand for telling the
compiler to link the file *liblammps.a*\ .

However, it is only as simple as shown above for the case of a plain
LAMMPS library without any optional packages that depend on libraries
(bundled or external).  Otherwise, you need to include all flags,
libraries, and paths for the coupled executable, that are also
required to link the LAMMPS executable.

*CMake build*\ :

When using CMake, additional libraries with sources in the lib folder
are built, but not included in liblammps.a and (currently) not
installed with "make install" and not included in the *pkgconfig*
configuration file.  They can be found in the top level build folder,
but you have to determine the necessary link flags manually.  It is
therefore recommended to either use the traditional make procedure to
build and link with a static library or build and link with a shared
library instead.

*Traditional make*\ :

After you have compiled a static LAMMPS library using the conventional
build system for example with "make mode=lib serial". And you also
have installed the POEMS package after building its bundled library in
lib/poems. Then the commands to build and link the coupled executable
change to:

.. code-block:: bash

   gcc -c -O -I${HOME}/lammps/src/STUBS -I${HOME}/lammps/src -caller.c
   g++ -o caller caller.o -L${HOME}/lammps/lib/poems \
     -L${HOME}/lammps/src/STUBS -L${HOME}/lammps/src -llammps -lpoems -lmpi_stubs 

Note, that you need to link with "g++" instead of "gcc", since LAMMPS
is C++ code.  You can display the currently applied settings for building
LAMMPS for the "serial" machine target by using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   make mode=print serial

Which should output something like:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Compiler: 
   CXX=g++
   # Linker: 
   LD=g++
   # Compilation: 
   CXXFLAGS=-g -O3 -DLAMMPS_GZIP -DLAMMPS_MEMALIGN=64 -I${HOME}/lammps/lib/poems -I${HOME}/lammps/src/STUBS
   # Linking: 
   LDFLAGS=-g -O
   # Libraries: 
   LDLIBS=-L${HOME}/lammps/lib/poems -L${HOME}/lammps/src/STUBS -lpoems -lmpi_stubs

From this you can gather the necessary paths and flags.  With
makefiles for other *machine* configurations you need to do the
equivalent and replace "serial" with the corresponding *machine* name
of the makefile.

----------

**Link with LAMMPS as a shared library**\ :

When linking to LAMMPS built as a shared library, the situation
becomes much simpler, as all dependent libraries and objects are
included in the shared library, which is - technically speaking -
effectively a regular LAMMPS executable that is missing the `main()`
function.  Thus those libraries need not to be specified when linking
the calling executable.  Only the *-I* flags are needed.  So the
example case from above of the serial version static LAMMPS library
with the POEMS package installed becomes:

*CMake build*\ :

The commands with a shared LAMMPS library compiled with the CMake
build process are the same as for the static library.

.. code-block:: bash

   mpicc -c -O $(pkgconf liblammps --cflags) caller.c
   mpicxx -o caller caller.o -$(pkgconf --libs)

*Traditional make*\ :

The commands with a shared LAMMPS library compiled with the
traditional make build using "make mode=shlib serial" becomes:

.. code-block:: bash

   gcc -c -O -I${HOME}/lammps/src/STUBS -I${HOME}/lammps/src -caller.c
   g++ -o caller caller.o -L${HOME}/lammps/src -llammps

*Locating liblammps.so at runtime*\ :
   
However, now the `liblammps.so` file is required at runtime and needs
to be in a folder, where the shared linker program of the operating
system can find it.  This would be either a folder like "/usr/local/lib64"
or "${HOME}/.local/lib64" or a folder pointed to by the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
environment variable. You can type

.. code-block:: bash

   printenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH

to see what directories are in that list.

Or you can add the LAMMPS src directory (or the directory you performed
a CMake style build in) to your LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, so that the current
version of the shared library is always available to programs that use it.

For the Bourne or Korn shells (/bin/sh, /bin/ksh, /bin/bash etc.), you
would add something like this to your ~/.profile file:

.. code-block:: bash

   LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH-/usr/lib64}:${HOME}/lammps/src
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

For the csh or tcsh shells, you would equivalently add something like this
to your ~/.cshrc file:


.. code-block:: csh

   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/lammps/src

You can verify whether all required shared libraries are found with the
`ldd` tool.  Example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/lammps/src ldd caller 
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe729e0000)
        liblammps.so => /home/user/lammps/src/liblammps.so (0x00007fc91bb9e000)
        libstdc++.so.6 => /lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007fc91b984000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007fc91b83e000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fc91b824000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fc91b65b000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fc91c094000)


If a required library is missing, you would get a 'not found' entry:

.. code-block:: bash

   $  ldd caller 
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd672fe000)
        liblammps.so => not found
        libstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007fb7c7e86000)
        libm.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007fb7c7d40000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fb7c7d26000)
        libc.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb7c7b5d000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb7c80a2000)

**Calling the LAMMPS library**\ :

Either flavor of library (static or shared) allows one or more LAMMPS
objects to be instantiated from the calling program. When used from a
C++ program, most of the symbols and functions in LAMMPS are wrapped
in a LAMMPS\_NS namespace; you can safely use any of its classes and
methods from within the calling code, as needed, and you will not incur
conflicts with functions and variables in your code that share the name.
This, however, does not extend to all additional libraries bundled with
LAMMPS in the lib folder and some of the low-level code of some packages.

To be compatible with C, Fortran, Python programs, the library has a simple
C-style interface, provided in src/library.cpp and src/library.h.

See the :doc:`Python library <Python_library>` doc page for a
description of the Python interface to LAMMPS, which wraps the C-style
interface from a shared library through the ctypes python module.

See the sample codes in examples/COUPLE/simple for examples of C++ and
C and Fortran codes that invoke LAMMPS through its library interface.
Other examples in the COUPLE directory use coupling ideas discussed on
the :doc:`Howto couple <Howto_couple>` doc page.
